# Melissa Pazzanese's Portfolio

## Description 

The Layout

the layout of this portfolio was built using Bootstrap. 

At the header section og this website I changed the title so it is aligned with the work. 

I also added a comment for the bootstrap CSS where I copied and pasted the CSS bootstrap link and I also added another comment to specify where is the custom css style for this template. 

This helps keeping the coding organised.
